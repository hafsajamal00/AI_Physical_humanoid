# Welcome to AI/Physical Robotics

This book guides AI engineers and robotics students through the transition from **digital AI** (web, mobile, cloud) to **physical/embodied AI** (robots, drones, autonomous vehicles).

## What You'll Learn

- **Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System** - Understand ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robots
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Learn simulation concepts for physics-accurate testing and visualization
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Master advanced perception and navigation with Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrate voice control, LLM planning, and autonomous execution (Capstone)

## Prerequisites

- Python programming basics
- Foundational AI/ML knowledge (neural networks, training, inference)
- Familiarity with software concepts (APIs, libraries, data structures)

## Get Started

Navigate to [Module 1: Chapter 1](/module-1/chapter-1-ros2-foundations) to begin your journey.
